# An Adaptive Fusion Algorithm for Visible and Infrared Videos Based on Entropy and the Cumulative Distribution of Gray Levels

## Experiments

each folder contains experiments from one dataset.

`1_vis.bmp`: the original visible frame.

`2_ther.bmp`: the original thermal infrared frame.

`pca.bmp`: the result of principle component analysis fusion.

`lap.bmp`: the result of Laplacian pyramid fusion.

`dwt.bmp`: the result of discrete wavelet transform fusion.

`GRW.bmp`: the result of generalized random walk fusion.

`GFF.bmp`: the result of guided filter fusion.

`our.bmp`: the result of the proposed algorithm.
